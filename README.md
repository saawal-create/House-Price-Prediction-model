# House-Price-Prediction-model

This project aims to predict house prices using machine learning techniques. It utilizes a dataset containing various features of houses, such as the number of bedrooms, bathrooms, square footage, and location, among others. By training a model on this data, the project can estimate the price of a house given its attributes.

 # Dataset
The project uses a dataset of house features and corresponding prices. The dataset should be in CSV format, with each row representing a house and each column representing a feature. The target variable, i.e., the house price, should be included in the dataset. You can provide your own dataset by replacing the original dataset file or specify the path to your dataset during training and prediction steps.

 # Model Training
The project employs a machine learning model for house price prediction. By default, a linear regression model is used, but you can experiment with other regression algorithms as well. 

 # Evaluation
The model's performance can be evaluated using various metrics such as mean squared error (MSE), root mean squared error (RMSE), or R-squared.
